## Getting Started

  This section will list what you need to have installed to use the software and how to install them. We'll use Homebrew as our package manager example. If you don't have Homebrew

  ```sh
  brew update
  ```

- Tap in to this git in shell to start using brew
  ```sh
  brew tap dms-x/dms
  ```

### Installation
1. install *minho* into your local shell (📁 'ls' with emojis)

    ```
2. install *hongdo* into your local shell (Photo file preview on terminal with ASCii art)
    ```sh
